### What is Spacelab

Spacelab is a people-incubator drawing from diverse, underrepresented communities and with a goal of building the leaders of tomorrow through the creation of cross-functional outer-space-focused projects.

Our first project uses Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks to discover and classify exoplanets or planets that orbit stars other than our own sun. We are excited to be able to build on models that NASA Fellows and Scientists first created in prior programs with similar aims.

Our current project, the Exoplanetarium, focuses on using data from previous and current NASA satellite missions in a convolutional neural network to search for additional planetary candidates that went unclassified by NASA. Our volunteers come from different disciplines, including data scientists, front-end developers, WebGL developers, and back-end developers, who collaborate and use innovative problem-solving to find potential exoplanets.

### Our Mission

Spacelab is building the next generation of leaders in outer-space-focused science and technology, drawing from diverse, underrepresented communities, including women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and people of color, and creating paid fellowships, internships, and scholarship opportunities, as well as debt relief.
